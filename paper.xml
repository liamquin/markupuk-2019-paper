			<para>Misunderstandings about the goals and strengths of different document and data interchange
				formats can lead to suboptimal decisions. Such misunderstandings appear widespread.
				The purpose of this paper is to suggest areas in which each format has strengths,
				and to provide clear explanations that people can use to place XML in the context of
				other current markup systems.</para>
			<para>Common misconceptions about XML include statements such as “XML was designed for Web
				services and therefore unsuitable for documents;” “XML was designed to replace HTML
				and has failed;” “XML cannot transmit semantics of any kind;” “XML is dead.” In
				fact, XML is alive and well. There are misconceptions about other formats, too, of
				course.</para>

		<title>Introduction</title>
		<para>Declarative markup languages have been around for many years. There were declarative
			systems built from Unix <emphasis>troff</emphasis> macro libraries in the 1970s and
			1980s, and of course SGML, Scribe, LaTeX and many others attempt to be more or less
			declarative and more or less general ways to represent and process documents with
			computers.</para>
		<para>The choice of which markup system to use should be based on clear well-understood
			criteria. These might include:<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Which notation has a closest fit to the document or documents. For
						example, a document with a lot of mixed markup and running text will be more
						difficult to process in some systems than others, as will a multilingual
						document;</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Which notation has associated tools that perform the processing the
						project needs;</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Which system the developers like the most or hate the most;</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Which system will be most likely to have active support for the entire
						duration of the project;</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>What will be the costs and what will be the gains of each format;</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>What are all the other similar projects using.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist></para>
		<para>Very often, the emotional aspects of the decision outweigh the technical aspects. This
			paper primarily explores the technical aspects, but also provides the reader with some
			ammunition to argue in the emotional arena.</para>
